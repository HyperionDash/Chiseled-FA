## <p align="center">Before You Ask</p>
**<p align="center">Q: Can i use this project in my published modpacks?</p>**
<p align="center">A: of course, you can do this with any of my projects aslong as the download stays hosted within the modrinth ecosystem :3</p>

**<p align="center">Q: Will this mod be ported to other loaders/versions?</p>**
<p align="center">A: ports are planned for the future of this mod, due to its simplistic nature, its not too hard to port to other loaders, however it is still in its early stages and wont be ported past nf 1.21.1 till its first full release, but due to a mess up, i will no longer be porting to other versions</p>

**<p align="center">Q: Why is there so little in the mod?</p>**
<p align="center">A: instead of waiting for the full mod to be finished, im instead releasing minor beta versions one at a time, each containing a new set of blocks expanding upon vanilla blocksets</p>
